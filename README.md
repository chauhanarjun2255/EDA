## Task 2 – Sales Performance Analysis 📊
---

## 📌 Overview
Task 2 focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Sales Performance Analysis** using Python.  
The task is divided into two parts:

- **Project 1:** General Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Project 2:** Sales Performance Analysis with Predictive Modeling

The goal is to clean the dataset, identify trends and patterns, visualize relationships, and build a simple machine learning model to predict sales.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Perform statistical analysis to understand data distribution
- Visualize trends, patterns, and relationships
- Analyze factors affecting sales performance
- Build a Linear Regression model to predict sales
- Generate insights and recommendations for business decisions

## 🔍 Project 1: General Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Steps Performed
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked data types, shape, and missing values
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values using mean, median, and placeholders
- Detected and removed outliers using the IQR method
- Performed statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Visualized data using:
  - Histograms
  - Boxplots
  - Correlation heatmaps

### Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset free from missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Summary of trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Visual representations of data distribution and correlations

## 📈 Project 2: Sales Performance Analysis

### Steps Performed
- Time-series analysis of sales over time
- Analysis of Profit vs Discount using scatter plots
- Sales distribution analysis by Region and Category
- Built a Linear Regression model to predict Sales
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

### Visualizations
- Sales trend over time
- Profit vs Discount scatter plot
- Sales by Region (bar chart)
- Sales by Category (pie chart)

## 💡 Key Insights
- Excessive discounts negatively impact profit margins
- Certain regions consistently outperform others
- Some product categories contribute more to total sales
- Sales trends show seasonal patterns

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Optimize discount strategies to improve profitability
- Focus marketing efforts on high-performing regions
- Promote top-performing product categories
- Use predictive models to support sales planning
